## Research

* Rich Hickey's talks on Clojure and language
* Paul Graham's articles on Lisp
* Bret Victor's talks
* Discussion on visual programming languages:
  <https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=14482988>
* XoL:
  <http://lignixz.github.io/blog/posts/17/xoL_graphics_based_programming.html>
  and <http://lignixz.github.io/xra9/>
* GP at HARC: <https://harc.ycr.org/project/>
* "No Silver Bullet": <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet>
* Origin of FLOW-MATIC and COBOL?
* Delphi?
* LabView: <http://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/labview/buy-labview.html>
* Grasshopper: <http://www.grasshopper3d.com/>
* iOS Interface Builder vs. Swift - how do you test that data shows up
  interfaces?
  * Visual Basic
  * <https://anvil.works>
* The Deutsch limit: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deutsch_limit
* DRAKON: http://drakon-editor.sourceforge.net/
* Visual programming within a domain: PureData
* <http://djedr.github.io/masters_thesis.pdf> - great breakdown of existing
  solutions, custom language w/ a prototype of visual representation
* Language workbenches:
  * JetBrains MPS: <https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/> - actually a pretty
    awesome toolkit!
    * it is a structure editor so it does not suffer from the constraints of
      text editors: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_editor>
    * it lets you create your own DSLs
    * it is very modular so you can extend languages or frameworks with custom 
      components and representations of code
    * this is pretty much what I want!!
  * XText: <https://eclipse.org/Xtext/>
* Dataflow programming: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataflow_programming>
  * Max/MSP
  * Pure Data
  * Full Metal Jacket: <http://web.onetel.com/~hibou/fmj/FMJ.html>
* <https://medium.com/@tiago.simoes/visual-programming-is-unbelievable-heres-why-we-don-t-believe-in-it-ad52ba24c98>
* Low-code programming: <https://www.outsystems.com/low-code-platforms/>

## Goals

* Make writing new code or debugging existing code much easier than it is now
* Show data as it flows through functions, control flow, logic
* Syntax should be the last problem when entering code!
* No need for tests as the editor visually checks everything already (but tests
  can be written if necessary)
* Helpful, friendly, human errors
* Language itself is free of extra syntax
* DSLs and custom visualizations are easy to build
* Standard library is actually useful (not just talking to databases but writing
  Markdown, spreadsheets, pulling from APIs - think of everything Mathematica
  can do)
