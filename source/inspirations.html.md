title: Inspirations
---

These are people who have built an online presence,
and in some cases who have built an offline presence as well,
that I have found inspiring in some way.
This is only a start for now —
I'll add to this as time goes on.

* **[Gary Bernhardt](https://www.destroyallsoftware.com)**.
  Gary is best known for his series *Destroy All Software*,
  where he posted content that no one else was creating:
  insanely high quality screencasts
  that broke apart cliche and often misunderstood concepts in programming
  and put them back together in fresh ways.
  His talks are just as excellent as his screencasts.
* **[Amit Patel](https://www.redblobgames.com/)**.
  I've always found the interactive nature of the web compelling.
  If a picture is worth a thousand words,
  then surely an *interactive* picture is worth a million words.
  Amit's site is a compendium for budding game developers
  who want to learn essential algorithms like pathfinding, map generation, and artificial intelligence.
  Rather than have you simply read words, though,
  he provides widgets where you can play with the concepts he's teaching you.
  It's an amazing resource:
  He's clearly poured thousands of hours into these articles,
  and he gives them all away for free.
* **[Stephen Wolfram](https://www.stephenwolfram.com/)**.
  Two words: Prolific genius.
  I've always wondered what it would have been like
  to live in the same time period as scientific figures we honor today,
  people such as Newton, Euler, Leibniz, Gödel, Einstein, Turing, and Nash.
  Fortunately, Mr. Wolfram has made it very easy to imagine, and then some.
  Here is a man who has clearly been curious about the nature of the universe since he was young
  and who has made use of technology to explore it in new and exciting ways.
  Every project he's embarked upon feels more and more ambitious,
  and I'm here for it.
* **[Tom MacWright](https://macwright.com/)**.
  Tom, a veteran of Mapbox and Observable, has a simple website:
  there's nothing to distract you from reading his blog posts.
  And his posts, which are published on a fairly regular schedule, are quite good!
  They are easy to read,
  they offer a few ideas in clear and concise ways,
  and then they end and leave the reader to ponder further.
