My neck finally felt better today. I was so relieved.

We woke up at our normal time this morning and spent a couple of hours working
(in Lori’s case) and writing (in my case).

By eleven, however, it was getting hot, so we decided to get into the pool. When
we got there, we were pleasantly surprised to find our Danish neighbors there,
as well as some new neighbors, a couple who lived up in the villas above the
pool. The couple looked to be in their 30s, and they lived in England. He, a
Venezuelan, worked as a freelance web developer, and she, a Brit, worked at a
startup that sold a meditation and focus training app. They were a nice addition
to our slowly building group, and all six of us lounged in the pool, beverages
in hand, chatting away for the next four hours.

At four-thirty in the afternoon, Lori and I said goodbye, headed out, and went
to Nativo. It was game time. When I sat down, I was given a free shot and
appetizer. There were lots of people there, but twenty dollar seats at a bar
never felt so good. I felt like I was royalty; I could envision a goblet of mead
to my right, a plate of grapes to my left, and servants fanning me on all sides.

My fantasy lifted and the Super Bowl started. It was nerve-wracking. Peyton
looked healthy, but the running game couldn’t push through as much as it could
in previous games, and the passing game wasn’t very effective, either. On every
third down but one, the Panthers’ defense left us coming up short and
empty-handed. Most of the points we earned ended up being credited to the
kicker.

The Broncos’ defense, on the other hand, was a force to be reckoned with and
gave Cam Newton a run for his money, or this case, to prevent from being sacked,
which eventually happened seven times.

It was an ugly game, but I fully expected Carolina to regroup at some point,
figure out our stupidly simple strategy, and fight back. Everyone did. Once
again, we proved we were stronger than we looked, and when the game ended and we
were announced the champions, I was honestly dumbfounded. It felt hollow, like
we had cheated somehow.

We didn’t win by throwing the most yards, or scoring the most touchdowns, or
running the ball the farthest, or having the spryest quarterback or the
winningest coach. We won by shutting down the other team.

It would be as if you owned a company and you rose to the top not by having the
best products, but by eliminating the competition. I think all of us are very
familiar with a corporation or two that exhibits these properties.

Perhaps this kind of behavior isn’t as deplorable as we make it out to be,
though. If you think about it, it’s perfectly natural. After all, we as humans
are at the top of the food chain. We know this, and we’re proud of it. How’d we
get there? We were smart and we figured out how to congregate, to communicate,
and to hunt down and kill the other animals.

Comparisons to game theory aside, after watching the Super Bowl, Lori and were
tired, and went straight to bed after getting home.
