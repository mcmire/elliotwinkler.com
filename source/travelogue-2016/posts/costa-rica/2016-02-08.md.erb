We found a new café this morning: Marianne, located in a little group of shops
called Plaza Kahuna. The wifi was good, the iced coffee was good, and they had
little pastries for a dollar each.

After spending some time here, we headed out to the beach. I felt bad that Lori
had wanted to explore the beach over the previous couple of days and I had
prevented her from doing that, so I told her to choose where to go this time. We
started out, took a right into some trees somewhere along the way, and stopped
the car. I offered to be the scout, so I jumped out and inspected the beach. The
shore curved slightly down into the water, which made the oncoming waves higher
and stronger than they usually were. Something was different: the water was
unusually high. I flip-flopped back to the car and reported the outlook,
concerned that it would be rough but suggesting that we give it a try
nonetheless.

It wasn’t what we had been used to at Playa Hermosa. There, the sand was flat
and spacious, giving ample room for the waves to subside. But here, the sea was
in a sinister mood, covering us with its alluring warmth, only to reverse
course, suck us into its clutches, and break and crash all over again, beating
us down and knocking us into the sand. It would not be enjoyable, we surmised,
and we exited this beach to visit our favorite one, Playa Hermosa, instead.

At first, Hermosa was relatively empty, and we were able to play in it with
ease. But as the time passed, more and more surfers began to populate the
waters. My fear was that one of them would crest an epic wave only to realize
that I was there and deck me in the face with their board. I didn’t want that to
happen, so we left hastily.

After a quick bite to eat at Taco, we headed back home. Our villas’ hosts were
holding a barbecue in the main dining area and had invited all of the tenants.
Lori and I made cocktails — a simple recipe of rum, lime juice, and pear juice
that we had bought at the Super Ronny the previous day — before joining up with
our Danish friends. We shared the day’s happenings with them, something that was
becoming a daily comfort, and continued to discuss real estate prices in Denmark
and compare it with that of Denver. (If you’re wondering, the prices in
Copenhagen are apparently extremely expensive, perhaps somewhere between New
York and San Franscisco.)

Dinner was grilled chicken, pork, and sausage. Everything was cooked perfectly,
and along with the meat, our hosts had even prepared egg and potato salad,
plantains, and a light lettuce salad. It was delicious — easily the best twenty
dollars we’ve spent here. And to think that Lori and I considered skipping it!
