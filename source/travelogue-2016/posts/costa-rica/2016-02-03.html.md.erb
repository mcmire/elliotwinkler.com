I was thinking about taking another surf lesson at eight this morning, but I
remembered that we were finally going to rent a car in the morning, and the
Budget representative was scheduled to show up at ten.

Costa Rica has a way of life that the locals call *pura vida*. I’m not
absolutely sure what it means, but I think if you abide by *pura vida* you take
as many opportunities as you can to enjoy life. But at the same time, you take
it easy, let things happen in their time, and don’t stress out too much. As an
example, even though the streets can be a little chaotic — people go past on
foot, bike, motorcycle, car or 4x4, sometimes fast, sometimes slow — road rage
just isn’t a thing. The saying is everywhere — on T-shirts, blankets and
stickers — and people use it as a greeting and as a farewell.

I guess *pura vida* applies to businesspeople, too — people don’t seem to
concern themselves with time. So when the representative said he’d show up at
ten, he of course really meant eleven. Lori and I met him when he arrived, and
presented the paperwork for us to review. It was mostly straightforward, except
for the insurance. Reasonably, the insurance we carried on our cars did not
apply, and although Lori had a USAA card, that did not apply in this case
either. So, we ended up having to pay extra for that. If I remember correctly,
the total bill was seven hundred dollars for ten days, and two hundred of that
was insurance. The good thing, I suppose, was that the insurance fee was across
the board, not per-driver. Additionally, we had to sign two forms, one for the
collision coverage, another to agree to pay a thousand-dollar deductible in case
we got into an accident while smoking or drinking. When we were done with that,
we went outside and the representative showed us the car. I was happy because he
had us go around the vehicle and check it for damage or scratches so that he
could document it. I also took pictures to provide proof.

After we got the car, Lori and I decided to go to Nativo. We wanted to watch the
Super Bowl on Sunday, but we had found out that the bar is an extremely popular
spot to watch it, so much so that you have to give them twenty dollars to
reserve a seat! That was a little ridiculous, but this was the best place in
town, and we wanted a front-row seat, so to speak, so we decided to get the
reservations.

Once we were done at the bar, we went back home briefly before heading out again
to go out. The girls had mentioned the day before that there were tidepools if
you went northwest of Santa Teresa along the coast. I wanted to look for a beach
that was approachable with a good shoreline. We ended up finding a nice place to
turn into — Playa Hermosa — and playing in the water there until the sun started
to go down. It was really serene, and we even ended up seeing a horse.

Once we’d gone back home and cleaned up a bit, we went into town in search of a
new place to eat. We saw a smaller shop called Taco that looked pretty good, so
we stopped there. In addition to selling — you guessed it — tacos, they also had
burritos, both of which were excellent and inexpensive. We would gladly go there
again.

It was the end of another day, and we both agreed that renting a car was so much
better than walking.
