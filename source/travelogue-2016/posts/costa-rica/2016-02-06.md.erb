Lori wanted to go the beach early today. I was tired; I am not a morning person.
But I didn’t want to be left alone, so I figured I should get up. We set out
northbound to find a new beach, as we had done the day before. We stopped to
scout one area, but it was really rocky and not particularly amenable to
walking. Besides, my neck was in pain still, and I wasn’t in the mood to do a
bunch of exploring today — I really wanted to be off the road and in the water
as soon as possible.

I finally convinced Lori that it would be best if we went somewhere familiar. So
we drove to Playa Hermosa and played there, and I felt much better.

After a couple of hours, Lori was hungry and wasn’t as interested in being in
the water as much as I was. So we came back to the room to wash up, have
breakfast, and rest for a bit.

By noon it had become hot outside again. Now that we had a way to get some cash,
we needed to run by the ATM. Additionally, Lori wanted to find a new spot for
lunch. As usual, we both wanted different things. Lori wanted to work, so she
needed a place that had wifi. I was about to melt, so I needed a place that had
air conditioning.

So we set off again. The cash was obtained — Lori, who had been stressed out
about it, breathed a sigh of relief — and we began our search for some kind of
café.

But as my neck quickly became more agitated, so did my mood. Normally, I am a
fan of going new places and trying new things. But now wasn’t the right time to
do that. I started to regret getting up as opposed to sleeping in, and I
considered what would have happened if I’d stayed in instead of going out.

Lori suggested we stop at Banana Beach, because that way we could kill two birds
with one stone and find out if it would be a better location to watch the Super
Bowl instead of Nativo. I played along, even though I knew I would have no
reprieve here from the heat, as all of the tables were outside. I was angry. I
turned away and quickly sought the shade of an umbrella, although it might as
well have been the cloud of my frustration. 

Mercifully, she rescued me, claiming that the prices were high, and we left.

Earlier, she had proposed going to the bakery, although we had been apprehensive
about it because we knew it was a popular spot and was very likely to be packed.
But at this point, I didn’t care. Why we hadn’t done this already, I didn’t
know, but this was the last stop. It had to be.

I needed something comfortable, something familiar, something to help me cope.
They had iced coffee and a burger. That would work nicely.

Slowly I began to cool down. The food gave me energy that I’d forgotten I
needed, and the iced coffee gave me a nice surprise — instead of using ice cubes
to make the coffee cold, the bakery had used shaved ice, creating a sort of
coffee Icee. It was delicious.

I was satisfied. But not only had I needed food, I needed my own space for a
while, and both of us knew it. So Lori dropped me off at Nativo, which was right
across the street, and I spent time doing what I’ve been doing most in my free
time: write. It was quite relaxing.

Before I knew it, the three hours we’d agreed upon were up, and Lori swung by to
pick me up and we headed back to our place. Our Danish neighbors, the ones we’d
met the day before, were sitting outside underneath the patio when we arrived,
and we stopped and chatted with them until the sun went below the horizon. It
was time for dinner, and Lori and I were planning on going to Soda Tiquicia, a
place recommended by one of our hosts that, according to TripAdvisor, was a
favorite of both locals and tourists alike. Would they like to go with us? Yes,
they said, and after cleaning up a bit, we headed off together.

Sure enough, the food there was rather tasty, and I could see why it was well
reviewed. My favorite part about it, aside from the reasonable prices, was that
the portions were large. It reminded me of going to a local eatery back home in
the South, except instead of chicken fried chicken or lasagna, there was ceviche
or beef tips (both of which were ordered). Everyone had a good time, and I
secretly wished we would go again.
