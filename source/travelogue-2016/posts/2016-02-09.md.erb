We had meant to go on a ziplining tour through the trees this morning, but it
didn’t work out. While we were at Nativo, Lori had noticed a Mal Pais Canopy
Tour logo on one of the bartender’s shirts. She put us in touch with someone who
worked there, and so we had been communicating with him via email. But he hadn’t
been responsive in giving us directions to the place in time for the tour.

So we decided to rent a surfboard and boogie board and head to Playa Hermosa
instead. The water felt great, and twice I managed to stand up and ride for a
good few seconds or so. Lori wasn’t having any luck at all with the boogie
board, though, so after about thirty minutes, I took it from her and gave her
the surfboard instead. The boogie board was a lot lighter and easier to handle
than the surfboard, so that was nice, but as much as I tried, I wasn’t able to
do anything with it, either. It was strange. Even though it was less than half
our heights, I figured that as long as I got up onto it, the water would carry
me, but as soon as I did so, I began to sink.

I traded boards with her again after a short while. But she was frustrated. Some
boys were playing in the water about a hundred feet away. One of them had a
boogie board like the one we’d rented and had no trouble riding waves left and
right. Lori felt that she’d been misled — that the lady at the counter failed to
tell us that boogie boards are for kids. That was it; she was out. She told me
she was going to Nativo and would come back to pick me up in an hour.

I tried to keep surfing, but the water seemed stronger, and I realized that I
had lost my upper body strength and could no longer properly push myself up onto
the board. So after about fifteen minutes, I resigned to the shore and sat down
on my board to look out upon the water. As usual, it was hot. I looked around at
the other people playing in the water and at the other surfers attempting to
catch waves. A stray dog was trotting on the beach and I beckoned to it to come
to me. It was friendly and allowed for me to pet it briefly before bounding away
to wander further. I waited for a while. I had about forty minutes to go and it
was quickly going to get boring if I didn’t have something to do.

I reached into the ground and gathered a handful of damp sand, placing it down a
few inches away. I removed another handful and slapped it on top of the previous
handful. Then again and again, over and over, until I had a hole and a pile of
sand. The rising tide rushed in and filled in the hole with water. I reached
into the hole and now what I pulled out was wet sand that dripped out of my
fingers. I had an idea, and reached in again. This time I quickly let the sand
drip out on top of the pile, creating formations that looked somewhat natural. I
did this over and over until I’d built some kind of stalagmite tower. It was
interesting and I leaned back a bit to admire my work.

I looked up to find Lori standing there. She looked tired. Apparently she’d been
napping in the car all this time and I hadn’t even known.

We headed out, dropping off the boards at the rental shop and going home for a
bit to freshen up. By this point we were both tired, having skipped lunch, so we
decided to go to a new restaurant for dinner, Caracolas.

All of the tables were outside and looked out over the water under the shade of
trees. It was beautiful. The sun, the giver of heat, was already setting when we
sat down, spreading its dying light across the horizon, and bands of pink and
orange light surrounded it, which reflected off of the edges of a few clouds
still present in the blue sky. Beyond palm trees, the waves lapped against rocky
land, and kids were playing and calling to one another on the shore. As evening
gave way to twilight and darkness fell, a sliver of the moon appeared overhead.

The margaritas were the best I’ve ever had, and the food was equally as
enjoyable. They had a wide selection on the menu, but I settled on seafood.
