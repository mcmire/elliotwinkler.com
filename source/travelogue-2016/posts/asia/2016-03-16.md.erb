Today I was in Penang, an island off the western coast of Malaysia. I hadn’t
planned on going there, though. In fact, I hadn’t planned on going to Kuala
Lumpur, either. Both had been recommendations by people I’d met at the hostel in
Singapore. So  after I left the Lion City, I had added Penang to my itinerary;
but when I reached KL, someone in the dorm suggested I visit Langkawi, another
island north of Penang. That sounded great to me. After all of the busy, noisy
traffic, narrow streets, and the abundance of man-made structures, I really
wanted to go to a beach, and while I’d heard that Penang was a good place to
visit, apparently, Langkawi was even better. So, the plan was this: to spend
time in Penang for a day, go to Langkawi for a few days, then try to make my way
to Bangkok.

The night before, I had arrived in Penang at 10:00 P.M. I had taken a train from
KL Sentral, the station in Kuala Lumpur, to Butterworth, the station nearby
Penang—a five-hour transit. Since I was still on the mainland when I got off the
train, I then had to take a taxi across the bridge to the island itself. I could
have taken a ferry, but when the taxi driver approached me, saying that driving
would be faster than taking a boat, I felt I had to accept his offer, even
though the price ended up being 77 ringit, or about $19. (In hindsight, that was
probably my only option, as ferries usually have specific times that they
depart.)

There had been some initial confusion when I’d given the driver the address of
the hostel where I was staying. I thought it was nearby the beach. This was an
incorrect assumption, as it was actually in Georgetown; in Penang, the “beach”
means the northern part of the island.

Because of this, I didn’t get to the hostel until 11:15. It was different than
the others I’d seen so far. When I first stepped into the lobby, I felt like I
was in the garage of someone who had just moved into the place. The walls were
stark white and looked like they’d been freshly painted. The floor was cement,
and there was nothing in the room but a single desk in the corner, a chair, and
a computer on the desk. I had to ask if I was in the right place! (I was.)

I walked past the lobby, past the dining area—which featured an island with
bread, a couple of toasters, and plates and glasses set out—and headed upstairs.
It was minimalistic here too: two long hallways complete with creaking
floorboards and aged walls where the paint had faded to gray. I opened the door
to my room and immediately met my roommates: first, a group of four from
Thailand, and later, a guy from Germany.

In the morning, I woke up and went downstairs to have some breakfast. There I
met a guy from Italy, although he was currently living in Amsterdam, as well as
a girl from Germany, although she spoke with an Australian accent. After
consulting with the front desk, the girl had decided she and her friend were
going to go to the park, the northwestern corner of the island. As for me, I
knew that I wanted to find some kind of beach before I left town. Batu Ferengghi
was the most popular spot, I learned, but because of this, it was also very
touristy. I didn’t want to be on a shoreline full of people; I didn’t want to
have to pretend I had a room at a resort to get access to the water. Another
beach area before that, Tanjung Bungah, seemed promising. Could there be
something there? There was only one way to find out.

Some planning was in order. First, since Tanjung Bungah was a distance away, I
would need a way to get there. That way was the bus. The bus company in Penang
was called RapidPenang, and the logo, I’d noticed, was the same as RapidKL, the
bus operator in Kuala Lumpur. I had a RapidKL card on me; might I be able to use
that to pay the fare? No, said the front desk, it was useless; I’d have to use
cash. This wasn’t ideal—I didn’t much like having to deal with paper bills out
in the open, especially in a time-sensitive scenario—but I would have to manage.

Second, since I would be in the water, I would need something to hold my
belongings and somewhere to stash them. I finally settled on a fanny pack that
I’d brought with me. It wasn’t ideal, either, as it would undeniably flag me as
a tourist, putting me at a slightly higher risk for theft (a very low risk, but
a risk nevertheless). On the other hand, it gave me one place to store my phone,
wallet, and camera. When I wanted to get in the water, all I had to do was find
a nice spot, out of the way, to hide it under, and I would be good.

With that in mind, I headed out. I managed to find the bus stop, which was
nearby, using my phone, and found other people waiting there as well. I thought
it odd that there was no marker, yet it was a known stop. A normal thing in
Penang, likely.

I stepped on and asked for the fare. The driver mumbled something in return. I
asked again, and I still couldn’t understand him, although I knew now that he
wasn’t speaking English. This was dumb. He was a bus driver—he was supposed to
speak English, wasn’t he? Well, maybe he wasn’t going to tell me the fare, but I
needed a ride, and I was going to sit down. I vented for a minute to the guy
sitting next to me, but I knew I  had to fix the situation—the driver was
staring me down in the rear-view mirror. I got up, walked up to the front, and
asked the question again. This time, he pointed to a ticket in his hand that
said “2.00 RM”. Satisfied, I pulled out two one-*ringgit* bills from my pack,
received the ticket, and sat back down.

The guy and I made conversation for a bit, and when I had arrived in Tanjung
Bungah, I got off. I walked a few yards, then stopped. Oh no! Still miffed about
the driver, and concerned with where I would need to go to reach the beach, I
had completely forgotten that I’d brought a water pack on the bus. Such a useful
thing, now gone. And there was nothing I could do about it.

I had to keep going. I noticed that there were a lot of buildings here, some of
them hotels. This didn’t seem right, but surely the beach was ahead.

The road, while only two lanes, was busy, more so than I’d anticipated. The
sidewalk next to it got narrower and narrower until it disappeared, and soon, I
was forced to walk in the grass, next to the guardrail.

After a while, I came to an empasse. The road curved to the right, and the
ground fell away, shadowed by trees, down a steep bank. It was impossible to
continue here. There were stone steps before the curve that led down to a
collection of shacks, and I thought about passing through and looking for
another staircase on the other side. But I felt like whoever lived
there—assuming someone did live there—probably wouldn’t appreciate some random
stranger wandering about their property. There was an alternative: on the other
side of the guardrail—in other words, on the road, next to all that traffic—was
a very narrow stone pathway of sorts. I could walk on that. It was perfectly
normal, anyway—I’d seen a local do it.

No, I thought, that was too dangerous. There must be some way to get around this
curve. I went forward, ducking under a tree branch that was blocking the bank,
and finally lowering onto all fours. The ground had a top layer of leaves and
loose dirt, making each step treacherous. It was tough. I took my time, seeking
out plants or harder earth as footholds to keep from slipping down. But after
twenty minutes, I was forced to stop. It was a fool’s errand to keep going like
this, and I knew it. I carefully climbed back up the bank.

That was it: I would have to risk the road. I took a deep breath, stepped over
the guardrail, facing traffic, and walked firmly along the stone path, rounding
the corner quickly. There was grass ahead next to the road—I could see it.
Before I knew it, I was out of harm’s way.

I confidently kept walking now, and presently, I came to another shack. This one
was different, as it was decorated with religious symbols. I wasn’t too sure
whether it was a home or a temple, but I could see that it was sitting on the
edge of the water. Hopeful, I kept walking. The shore continued into more of a
cove, and there was a beaten path in the grass leading down to a sandy shore. I
happily followed it.

I swam here in the water for a bit to satisfy my immediate want. It was nice
because there was no one there, but I knew it wasn’t quite the beach I had in
mind. There were large rocks in the water, partially blocking the way, and they
were encrusted in barnacles, making them spiky. It forced me to swim slowly,
carefully, always afraid that I’d encounter one hidden in the water.

So I got out and moved on. After ten more minutes, I came to a second beach.
(They called it Miami; I wasn’t sure if it was named after our beach, or
something else.) This was a lot better—there were food stands here, the place
was open, families were leading their children to the water, and Westerners were
busy sunbathing. All of my walking had paid off!

I enjoyed the water for a little bit; but it was very warm, not such a relief on
a humid day, and so I spent most of the time looking out at the water instead. I
watched as Malaysian parents walked their children down and parked their things
in a corner. Sometimes Mom and Dad would stay behind as their boys or girls
would happily play in the water; sometimes they’d hover over their kids by the
tide. No one owned any swimsuits, which either meant they were too
immodest—Malaysia is primarily a Muslim country—or simply unnecessary. No one
was the wiser; everyone was a happy camper.

At 5:00, I was getting tired, and I started making my way back, reaching a bus
stop. Surprisingly, the same guy I’d ridden the bus with on the way over was
standing there, too. Maybe he had seen my water pack on the floor and grabbed
it! But no; he thought it was left over from some previous bus ride and didn’t
know it was mine. Well, it was gone for good after all. Another casualty.

Back at the hostel, I met up with my roommates, who I wished I could spent more
time with, and chatted with the German guy specifically about traveling. I
mentioned that I was going to Lankawi next, and he, having already spent a few
months in that direction, suggested that I add a few more destinations to my
list, naming several islands that I could visit on the way to Thailand. It
sounded fun, but I knew I couldn’t see everything; something would have to be
dropped. But it was perfectly fine. I could always come back; there would always
be more to see. For this trip, as long as I reached an amazing beach, I would be
happy.
