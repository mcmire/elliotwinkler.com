Lori and I met some of our neighbors today. We were sitting in the breakfast
area — a covered patio downstairs from the rooms themselves — and two women,
likely friends, were sitting at a table talking about how they were going to
rent a car in order to go to a surfing lesson. Naturally, we struck up a
conversation with them. They mentioned that they were staying here in Santa
Teresa for a week more, but they hadn’t started out here. In fact, this was the
fifth place they’d stayed, having flown into Liberia but snaking a scenic route
through some towns first before ending up here. They had already gone ziplining
and were planning on going canoeing later in the week.

If you remember from last time, Lori and I had been debating whether or not to
rent a car. The fact that these girls had done so pushed us over the edge and we
ultimately decided that’s what we were going to do first thing the next day. In
the meantime, we needed to figure out what to do today. Lori had to work at some
point, but we hadn’t been to the beach yet, and I wanted to at least walk down
and check it out.

The girls kindly offered to give us a lift down the hill, as long as they could
drop us off at the surf shop where they were taking their lesson. That was fine.
Lori wanted to go to Nativo again — this was a bar that she really liked and the
one we were at the day before — so she could get some work done. After we said
goodbye to the girls, she asked if I wanted to take a lesson at the same place
as well. I did want to, but I have this weird thing where if I’ve already said
goodbye, I don’t want to do it again. So I said, “Let’s keep going.”

We started walking down the street, and two doors down we came across another
surf shop. A lady walked out and asked if either of us needed a lesson, and Lori
pointed in my direction. The lady said that there was a class about to start in
five minutes, it was two hours, and only two people were signed up. Did I want
to join? I thought about it for a second. There was no reason not to say no, so
why not? “Okay,” I said. “*Sí*?” she said. “*Sí*,” I said.

After Lori paid (as she had the credit card), I met the instructor and the guy
and girl that I would be taking the lesson with, who I later learned were from
Buenos Aires. The shop gave me a rash guard to wear so I wouldn’t tear up my
chest when I got on the board later, and I put that on. We walked outside, and
he had the guy and me carry two boards while he carried the girl’s board. The
boards were thicker and heavier than I thought.

We set off toward the beach, which was perhaps 100 yards away. When we got to
the shore, the instructor — who would speak to the couple first in Spanish, then
repeat the instructions to me in English — had us set the boards down before we
got to the water, as we didn’t need them straight away. He then led us to the
sand near the water, had us draw the outline of a surfboard with our finger with
a line down the middle to divide it in two, and started giving us the
fundamentals.

The first thing he showed us was how to get up onto the board. There are four
steps involved: First, you lie on the board with your feet sticking out just
past the end of the board. You’ll probably need to paddle, and when you do so,
you don’t use both hands at once, but you alternate hands, just like oars in a
canoe. Second, you essentially perform a push-up, placing your hands at chest
level and keeping your legs straight. Third, you bring your back foot up first
and plant it toward the back of the board, at which point you can start standing
up; and as you rise fully, you place your front foot down, keeping your knees
bent and your body facing perpendicular to the board.

With this technique in place, he then had us fetch the boards and we were ready
to try it out for real in the water. The first three times, we closely followed
his lead — he would tell us when to get on the board, hold us in place until a
wave came, and then push us off and shout out to paddle or to stand up. I
actually managed to stand up properly and ride out a wave for a good five
seconds or so!

Then I decided to start practicing on my own, and that’s where things started to
fall apart. I never really managed to stand up on the board properly after that.
Even when I went back to the instructor for him to help me, I would keep
forgetting to put my back foot on first, and so I’d be up for about two seconds
before the board tipped and I fell off.

We did this for six or seven more times. It was exhausting, having to jump onto
the board, situate myself correctly, attempt to stand up, fall off, get up, and
walk the board back into the ocean, far enough so that I could catch another
good wave.

Just like that, the two hours were up. The instructor and the girl in the couple
were already back at the shoreline, so the guy and I walked back together and
met him there. The couple rejoined, and after a bit of confusion, I realized
that they were going to take two of the boards and surf on their own. So the
instructor gave me the third board, and I walked back with him to the surf shop.
Did I mention before that surfboards are heavy?

I returned the board to the instructor, thanked him for the lesson, and said
goodbye. Lori had told me that she was going to be at Nativo, and she’d even
left a note saying so. I wasn’t close to the bar, though, and I knew it would
require some walking — I just didn’t realize much! It probably took a good 30 to
45 minutes before I finally arrived. (We measured it the next day and from our
place to Nativo was about 2 km, or 1.5 miles.)

Lori and I hung out at the bar for a while. I met a guy who was from Canada and
two girls who were from California. The guy mentioned how he’d been to Santa
Teresa five times — he loved it — and was seriously considering purchasing some
property and living here half of the year. I thought that was a great idea.
Property here is expensive, but it’s obviously a tourist spot, and will likely
get more and more popular over time.

After the bar, Lori and I walked down to the beach and sat down to watch the
sunset. It was beautiful. The ocean roared softly, lapping against the sand.
People were playing in the water, and surfers were catching a few remaining
waves. A light blue sky slowly turned to pink, and presently the sun dipped
below the horizon.

As it was getting dark, we walked back to the street. We were hungry and Lori
wanted to go to a new place. We walked over to Hotel Tropico Latino, where there
was a restaurant in the back. The whole area looked luxurious. It was quiet and
distanced from the road, and the cabinas were walled off from each other by
hedges. The restaurant was fancy to match. The tables were outside under a
patio, and there were little pools off in the distance behind the building. As
for the food itself, it was good and presented really well — I ordered the
tenderloin with asparagus — but the dessert wasn’t too impressive, so they lose
points in my book for that. But they did take credit cards, which was critical
in our case.

We left the restaurant and exited the hotel area onto the main road. We spent
some time meandering through stores that sold clothes and trinkets. We had
messaged our taxi driver earlier, but after killing some time, we hadn’t gotten
a response from him yet. We could have asked for another taxi, I suppose, but I
suggested that we start walking back toward the cabin and perhaps we could hail
one on the way if it happened to come by.

So we walked. We walked past Nativo, the Italian restaurant, the taco shop, and
the Super Ronny. Still no response. Eventually we came to the intersection that
led to the right and up the hill. “We’re committed now, aren’t we?” Lori said.
The hill was going to be steep — we knew that. But the girls from earlier that
morning had trudged all the way up it, so why couldn’t we? “It won’t be so bad,”
I offered.

It was strenous — a lot more strenous than I thought it would be. Think of a
Stairmaster cranked all the way up and you’ll get an idea of how hard it was. We
secretly vowed never to do it again. Needless to say, we slept well that night.
