We woke up around seven to the sound of birds I hadn’t heard before and a
persistent rooster in the distance. The air inside the house had a particular
aroma that was strange but homey, musty but sweet, and I smelled it again that
morning. It had been hot throughout the night — the house had no air
conditioning, only a fan — but we were so tired after planning today's events
that it didn’t matter.

Our plan, if you recall from last time, was to take the bus from Liberia to
Santa Teresa. Actually, we had to take one bus, a ferry, and then two more
buses. The prospective itinerary looked like this:

* 10:30am: Bus from Liberia to Puntarenas
* 2:00pm: Ferry from Puntarenas to Paquera
* 5:00pm: Bus from Paquera to Cóbano
* 7:00pm: Bus from Cóbano to Santa Teresa

Lori contacted the man next door, the cousin of the woman who owned the Airbnb
we were in, to call a taxi. We had the driver take us first to an ATM so that I
could get some *colones*, and then he dropped us off at the bus station. The bus
actually left at ten-thirty, so Lori and I had plenty of time to kill. The bus
station was covered, and cornering the space were shops that sold candy or
clothes or small items. So we walked around a little and had a bite to eat.
There were some people we knew from Denver that we’d seen at the airport, and we
bumped into them here, too.

So far on this trip, I’d remained calm and in a good mood — if any hint of
discomfort arose, I remained positive. That attitude changed at the bus station.
We needed to pay for the bus in colones, as it would be slightly cheaper than
using dollars. I had a few ten thousand bills that I’d gotten at the ATM, but we
needed smaller bills, so Lori told me to buy something small, and pay for it
using one of those bills, so I’d end up with at least a 5,000 and a 1,000. I
walked into one of the shops and chose something that would fulfill the goal and
also be useful for me — a Powerade — and handed it to the lady at the counter. I
asked, “*Cuanto cuesta*?” When she answered with the price, I froze, trying to
figure out what she’d said. “*Sesenta*?” I said, repeating the last fragment of
what I’d heard. She said the price again, and again, I didn’t hear correctly. I
stood there for a split second until she said, “This is good,” reaching for and
taking the five thousand bill I had in my hand. I gave a very quick “*Gracias*”
and left with my Powerade.

I didn’t realize what I’d done — that I’d used the wrong bill — until I came out
of the store. That, of course, made me feel stupid. The bus driver had had
change at the door all along, so it didn’t end up mattering, but now I knew that
I wasn’t able to handle myself well in a situation where I had to speak Spanish,
and that stayed with me for some time.

We started on our way. The bus moved at a clip down the main and newest
thoroughfare in Costa Rica, the 1, a two-lane road. As I mentioned last time,
driving on roads here is, how shall we say, more exciting than in the U.S. The
road was barely wide enough to fit a whole bus in the lane going forward, and
cars in the left lane going in the opposite direction raced by, with hardly any
shoulder space at all. Of course, lanes aren’t really a thing here
either — vehicles that wanted to go faster than the bus (an easy feat) usually
passed it on the left side, facing oncoming traffic, and then quickly maneuvered
back into the right lane again. I was very glad to leave navigating this
craziness to the bus driver.

The scenery that we passed seemed peaceful, and there were mostly open spaces of
trees: looming, stout, sprawling, and tropical. The small towns we would drive
through occasionally were all alike. It was clear that the main road was the
backbone. The neighborhoods themselves contained simple ranch style
houses — some concrete with clay shingles, others quickly painted red, yellow or
blue, with metal fences wrapping around the property. It wasn’t extremely
different than the U.S., but it was different enough that you could tell you
weren’t just in California or Tijuana.

Outside it was ninety degrees and inside it was ninety percent humidity, so the
windows were open, and the smell of the air, which had a slight tinge of
sweetness to it, wafted freely through the bus. It was close to the same odor
I’d smelled in the house earlier, but it seemed more natural.

After a few hours, we arrived at Puntarenas, and the sight of water was a
relief. We got off the bus and took a taxi ride to the ferry that would lead us
across the bay that Puntarenas sits on. Once on board, it was nice to look out
at the water.

The ferry had a bar that sold drinks, so I wanted to get one. That was when the
second bad thing happened today: I realized that I didn’t have my debit card
with me anymore. I quickly backtracked. It was possible that someone had
pickpocketed me as I was getting onto the bus, but it was probably more likely
that it fell out of my back pocket at some point beforehand, such as in the taxi
to the first bus, and I just hadn’t noticed. I promptly put my card on hold to
stop the bleeding, so to speak, but the damage had been done. Now I wasn’t just
frazzled, I was angry. Here I was, in a foreign country, unable to get money for
myself. On top of that, I was still frustrated because of my inability to
communicate.

The ferry ride took about a couple of hours, and it took me that long to settle
down. We were now in Paquera, so we got off and walked to the bus station
located at the ferry port. It was very busy there. The bus was very crowded, and
Lori and I would have to stand. The best way to describe this bus was that it
felt like a roller coaster. The roads here were gravel or poorly paved roads, as
opposed to the 1, which actually hadn’t been too bad. We stood in the middle
aisle, holding on to the bars above and to the left and right sides, swinging
and jostling with every curve or bump. Finally, here was an adventure! (My
traveling companion, in contrast, was not too amused.)

We were further into the country at this point, and the scenery was
different — instead of plains and rolling hills, we began seeing more and more
palm trees and small villages. Of course, the driving was just as crazy, and the
humidity was just as suffocating.

The bus stopped in Cóbano, and we got off to get onto a different bus which
would finally take us to Santa Teresa. *(Side note: if you’re considering a trip
of your own here, note that the Cóbano bus stop isn’t exactly in the same
location as the town of Cóbano, as reported by Google Maps — it stops short of
where you might think. Just look outside, and you’ll see more an established
town, as opposed to a village.)*

When we rolled into the Santa Teresa area, we discovered another problem: we
didn’t yet have the address of the place we were staying. This was my fault, I
freely admit — in my desire to “figure it out as we go along”, I’d only told my
Airbnb contact that we’d call him when we were there. Well, we were there now.
Lori and I quarreled for a bit as I shared this information — I told her coolly
that everything was fine and we could just get off at a stop and walk down to
where we needed to go, and she, understandably panicking, felt like we should
have that information ahead of time. I was annoyed, but I agreed to call him,
did so, and learned that we happened to be in exactly in the right place.

So we got out, but then after talking to some locals, we realized that we had
yet another problem: the place we were staying was apparently on the top of a
mountain, and we needed a car to get up there. So I called the man back again,
and he called for a taxi to pick us up. We reached the top, got out, and were
greeted by a man who, in my exhaustion and confusion, I misunderstood to be the
Airbnb contact.

He showed us our room. It was nice — perhaps not exactly like the picture
online, but fairly close. He then took us to the dining area, where there was a
bar, and said that we could make our own cocktails, although they would be
extra. Of course, this was all in Spanish, which, as I have mentioned, I am not
particular good at. So I stood mute while Lori chatted with the man, and became
annoyed that I was being mostly excluded from the conversation. This was a
wholly new feeling for me. I didn’t like it.

Thankfully, after an hour or so of this, he told us that he was retiring to bed,
and we did the same. It had been a long day, and I was ready for it to be over.
