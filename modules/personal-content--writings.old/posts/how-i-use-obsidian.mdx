[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is the tool I use to keep digital notes — to jot down thoughts and ideas about life and work, plan and track side projects, write long-form content like this, and more.

In this post, I'll document how I use Obsidian, how I've tweaked it to fit my needs, and how that's evolved over time.

## How I used to use Obsidian

%%I have a lot of notes that I imported from [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/), the last app that I used for many years. These started out in `Notes/`%%

%%When I first started using Obsidian, I already had a sizeable collection of notes from the previous app I used for many years, [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/).%%

When I migrated from [Simplenote](https://simplenote.com/) to Obsidian, I brought over a sizeable collection of notes. %%Most of these notes were hastily-written lists of things — PINs for certain accounts, things to do in certain cities, cool band names — and alongside them I had some diary entries as well.%%  Everything was located in one directory, though, and I had the urge to "organize" them. I split up my notes, creating a directory for each type. Meanwhile, I discovered Dataview and became intrigued with the idea of creating dynamically updated notes. I began experimenting with "objects", making use of Obsidian's properties feature to create files that acted more like entries in a database. My notes even became more structured as I began using Obsidian for planning and research. I made fewer lists and made more documents with multiple headers and sections. And I added even more directories as I started new projects.

As I kept using Obsidian, though, something didn't feel right. I had this ever-growing body of files %%, and so far if I wanted to search for something, chances are I could still find it, but I didn't how how long that would last. It felt like something%% that it felt like I was losing control of. I didn't feel like it was representing me well.

At the same time, I was also trying out Logseq and Roam. For both of these tools, you are highly encouraged to avoid imposing a structure on your notes using the filesystem, but allowing that structure to grow organically. [^fn1] [^fn2] More that that, though, the authors of these tools believe that since life happens chronologically, the best and most efficient way to add new things is via journaling. [^fn3] (In fact, when you load the app, you are automatically sent to an automatically generated note for the current day.)

This wasn't a completely new idea to me. I've always kept some kind of diary in some kind of form since I was young, and I had continued doing so with Obsidian. But I only tended to write something down when I'd gone through a particularly meaningful experience.

It hadn't occurred to me to use date-based notes _every time I wanted to add something new_.

## How I use Obsidian now

These days I try to keep things simple.

I still find directories useful, but I've limited myself to three:

- `Diary/` — Date-based. Most of these entries are conversations between different voices in my head. I'll let them say what they want to say and move on. I don't typically go into a lot of detail (good luck to whoever reads this in the future!).
- `Log/` — Date-based. Ostensibly a "development log", but really it's the opposite of `Diary/`. These entries tend to be more rounded out, and I tend to revisit them multiple times per day. If I read an interesting article about politics, life, or work, and it inspires me, I'll write out my thoughts. If I'm reading a book, I'll keep notes. If I have an idea for a new side project, I'll map it out. Or If I'm actively working on a project, I'll "live blog" the experience, noting the problems I'm facing and the solutions as I attempt to solve them. I have found this step in particular incredibly valuable. For instance, if I put a project on hold and come back to it a year later, I can go back in my notes, see I was headed when I left off, and I can very easily pick up the thread again.
- `Notes/` — Non-date-based. Most of my old notes are here, but I still tend to use this category to hold stuff that I don't want to be buried in a journal entry. Each one tends to center around a concept or theme, and some are more structured than others. Examples are: results of research for big-ticket items (e.g., baby strollers, cars, etc.), lists of potential baby names, plans for trips, etc.

Beyond this structure, I've started using tags to link notes together. For instance, if I want to

I've always kept a journal of some kind.

I like being able to look back 

One of the things that has always appealed to me about digital notes is the idea that as you add content, you are adding this corpus of data … you're creating this system … you're capturing all of this knowledge that you have, over time







## Types of notes

The notes in my vault don't always fall into neat lines, but here are some patterns that have emerged over time:

- **Journal entries:** I use these kinds of notes to jot down ideas that come to mind throughout the day or thoughts I have as I work through a problem. I borrowed this idea from [Logseq](https://docs.logseq.com/#/page/getting%20started%20with%20the%20journals%20page) — another tool I tried out before Obsidian — and over time I've found them to be incredibly valuable. I have templates I can use to quickly generate a new note for the day. I don't stress too much about what I'm writing down, but I do like to keep these notes pretty readable. The file always contains the creation date in the name itself. I try not to edit journal entries, although if I have to stop mid-sentence and don't get a chance to finish before the day ends, I'll usually complete it the next day.
- **Lists:** I love lists, and they're easy to create and update quickly.
- **Research notes:** When I'm making a big purchase and there are several options available, I will typically create a note that compiles a bunch of facts about each option — price, features, pros and cons — as well as reviews from popular sites. Once I've collected enough information, I'll begin rejecting options, sorting the candidates by preference, and then finally record the winner.
- **Pages:** Notes that represent a concept, a project, or a person. They tend to be somewhat structured and may even use things like footnotes.
- **Scratch pads:** Basically everything else, i.e., free-form notes that I use to record things like measurements, doctor's visits, etc.
%%- **Objects:** Leftover from when I was briefly experimenting with Dataview. Like pages, they objects represent a person or thing, but unlike them, they are way more granular, functioning more like a record in a database. They have a lot of metadata peroperties as well as a descriptIon. I don't really use this pattern anymore.%%

## Embracing emergence

%%I try to be pragmatic when it comes to organization.%%

When I first switched to Obsidian, I kept everything in one directory. As time went on, I found it useful to have three directories: `Diary/` for personal diary entries, `Log/` for devlog entries, and `Notes/` for everything else. Over time, I added new directories for large side projects or experiments with plugins like Dataview.

%%But this structure has continually rubbed me the wrong way. First, as I alluded to above, some directories like `Objects/` aren't useful anymore. Second, it's inconsistent: for notes related to side projects in particular, some are located at the top level, and some are in `Notes/` (I can't decide which strategy feels "right"). And third… it just looks complicated.%%

%%### Not organizing notes%%

I still find separating journal entries from other kinds of notes to be useful. But in general, most of the structure that I've created feels overly complex.

Lately, I've tagging notes. I'm not sure why I didn't start doing this from day one. I tag [bookmarks](https://pinboard.in/) all the time and bringing them over to notes feels very natural, since I already have a standard set in my head I can draw from.

Tags spark joy for me. I don't need to keep an organization system in my head

it embraces the free-form nature of information, keep mental overhead low, — it doesn't allows my notes to be unstructured and boundary-less — and provides a simple way to link everything together.


One thing I've been trying to figure out is how to tag different sections of a note. I don't think 

, I don't know why I thought they wouldn't work for notes. They're easy to add — I tend to use hashtags rather than tag properties for this reason — and I don't have to think too hard about what to use.

And  — and they don't make things harder to find later. I don't add tags as properties; I tend to place hashtags directly in the body of the note rather than add a property, because  

%%
— although I can't decide whether they should sit either at the top level or within `Notes/` itself, so I use both. Admittedly, I'm not perfectly happy with my use of directories, but they do serve _some_ purpose, so they are here to stay, at least for now.

Besides this

## Workflows

These days I have a few workflows depending on what I want to do:

- If I want to create a journal entry, I go to or pull up the ribbon, choose QuickAdd, choose Log or Diary

## Plugins

I use a modicum of built-in plugins: Command palette, Files, Outline, Page preview, Properties view, Quick switcher, Search

A modicum of custom plugins: Commander, Custom File Extensions Plugin, Outliner, QuickAdd, Smart Typography, Vimrc Support


## Syncing Obsidian

I don't use Obsidian Sync …
